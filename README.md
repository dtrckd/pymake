# PYMAKE

Pymake (pmk) is a machine friendly environment for making reproducible research. It provides tools adapted to ease the creation, maintenance, tracking and sharing of experiments. It has two main paradigms:

* Manage and navigate in your experiments, as a **command-line** interface.
* Models and workflows for Machine Learning experiments, as a **framework**.

It follows a Don't-Repeat-Yourself ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)) philosophy and propose a workflow called Model-Spec-Action (MSA) which is in the spirit of former Model-View-Controller ([MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)) design pattern but adapted for computer simulations, generally speaking.

It can be represented as follows:

![MSA Model](wiki/msa.png)

<!-- Build Powerful CLI | Create Beautiful UI | Browse your Experiments  -->


<!--  MSA Model-Specification-Action (or DMSA to add the layer data...)

Web development methods introduced Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm (and others) to help and improve the workflow of developers.

Pymake comes with a similar idea but with a more general, high level point of view, by saying that a a lot of use-cases in computer science can be embedded within the following paradigm:

## Glossary and Types

* *run* or *expe*: It is the term that design one single experiment. it is related to an atomic, sequential code execution.
* *model*: A class that have a method named `fit` and located in `model/`.
* *spec*: A spec is a design of experience. it is defines by a subset of Expspaces, ExpTensors and ExpGroups.
* *script*: A script is a file containing a list of actions,  (see *ExpeFormat*).
* *actions*: An action is basically one method in a script that can be triggered by users. The term script is often used instead of *action* by misuse language.
* *ExpSpace*: A dict-like object used to stored the settings of one *expe*.
* *ExpTensor*: A dict-like object to represent a set of *expe* with common parameters. Each entries that are instance of `list` or `set` are used to build the Cartesian product of those entries. It is used to defined grid search over parameters.
* *ExpGroup*: A list-like object to defined a set of heterogeneous expes.
* *ExpeFormat*: A base class used to create scripts. It acts like a sandbox for the runs. The classes that inherit ExpeFormat should be located in `script/`.
* *ExpDesign*: A base  class used to create design of experience. The experience of type ExpSpace, ExpTensor and ExpGroup should be defined within class that inherit ExpDesign and located in `spec/`.
* *pymake.cfg*: the pymake configuration file, where, for example, the name of the location (model/, spec, model/) can be changed among other settings.
* *gramarg*: It refers to a file, by default in gramarg.py, where you can tune the command line options of pmk by adding your onw. The command line option grammar is powered by the python module argparse.

## Examples [](#3)

We provide an example of a design workflow with pymake by providing a **Search Engine** experience. The project is located in the `repo/docsearch` directory.

The context of the experiment is as follows:
* **Data**: documents to search-in are pdf documents (like articles for example),
* **Model**: A bm25 model, that assumes a information model of bag of words representation.
* **Script**: There are two scripts:
    + a fit script that builds the index of the *input data*,
    + a search script that returns relevant documents, given a *query*.
* Experiment **Spec** are defined individually for each scripts in the attribute `_default_expe` in the class headers.


Setup the experiment (needed just once). You may first need to clone the repo:

```bash
cd repo/docsearch/
make setup
```

You may also need the following package: `apt-get install poppler-utils`

Then a typical pymake usage:

```bash
pmk run --script fit --path path/to/your/pdfs/   # index your pdf documents, take a coffee
pmk run --script search "your text search request"  # show relevant information
```

Or equivalently (aliases):

```bash
pmk -x fit --path path/to/your/pdfs/
pmk -x search "your text search request"
```

Or show only the first match:  `pmk -x search "your text search request" --limit 1`

To add new models, new scripts, or specs,  you need to create it in the dedicated folder following the base class implementations.

Then you can list some information about pymake objects:

* What experiments are there: `pmk -l spec`
* What models are there: `pmk -l model`
* What scripts are there: `pmk -l script`
* Show signatures of methods in scripts ('ir' script)\: `pmk -l --script ir`

## FAQ [](#4)


###### How to share memory between all expe/run in a sandbox (ExpeFormat)

If the run/expe are launched sequentially (without `--cores` option), one can use a global container defined in the ExpeFormat sandbox classes in the variable `self.D`. Typically one would init variables at the first experience, process it, and at the final run, do some processing with that variable, as illustrated in the following example:

```python
class MyScripts(ExpeFormat):

    def my_action(self):
        if self.is_first_expe():
            self.D.my_shared_var = 0

        my_shared_var = self.D.my_shared_var
        my_shared_var += 1

        if self.is_last_expe():
            print('Expe total: %d' % self.D.my_shared_var)
```


If the runs are parallelized (with `--cores` options), there is no current implemented way to do it although it is likely to be develloped in the future.


###### How to tune the command-line options

The pymake.cfg have a settgins, by default `gramarg = project_name.grammarg`, which point to the python file gramarg.py. Inside this file you can add command-line options, fully compatible with the `argparse` python module. By default the file contains an empty list. If you want, let's say to set a parameter in your expe with the command line like this `pmk --my_key my_value` you can add a element in the list as follows:

```python
_gram = [
    #'--my_key',dict(type=str, help='simple option from command-line'),
]
```



###### How to change a setings in a spec from command-line whithout specifying it in the grammarg file

Pymake provide a mamgic command line argument to specify any field in an expe. Let's say you want to give the value `my_value` in the field `my_key` in your expe, then you can do `pmk [...] --pmk my_value=my_key`. You can chain as many key=value pairs like this.



###### How to activate Spec/Script auto-completion

The command, `pymake update` build the auto-completion file for bash. To enable it, put the following lines at the end of your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
if [ -d $HOME/.bash_completion.d ]; then
    if [ ! -z $(ls $HOME/.bash_completion.d) ]; then
        for bcfile in $HOME/.bash_completion.d/*; do
            . $bcfile
        done
    fi
fi
```

If you want to enable the auto-completion, open a new terminal or just run `source ~/.bashrc`.

##### Workflow / Directory Structure

In a pymake project there is 4 main components, associated to 4 directories (you can change those names in the pymake.cfg):

* `data/`: Where are storer input/output of any experiments,
    + contains datasets (and saved results) <!--  selection with the `-c` options and see frontendManager -->,
* `model/`: It represents our understanding of the data,
    + contains models -- every class with a `fit` method <!-- selection with the `-m` options and see ModelManager -->,
* `script/`: Code that operate with the data and models,
    + contains scripts for actions, -- every class that inherit `ExpeFormat` <!-- selection with the `-x` options -->
* `spec/`: It is the specifications of the context of an experiment. In order words, the parameters of an experiment.
    + contains specification of (design) experiments (`ExpSpace`,`ExpTensor` and `ExpGroup`), -- can be given as an argument of pymake.

Along with those directory there is two system files:
* pymake.cfg: at the root of a project (basically define a project) specify the paths for the `data | model | script | spec`  and other global options, <!-- document each entry -->
* gramarg.py: defines the command-line options for a project. <!-- explain the exp_append type -->


##### Pymake Commands

Initialize a new project in the current directory:

    pymake init

If new models or scripts are added in the project, you'll need to update the pymake index:

    pymake update


List/Search information:

```bash
pmk -l spec   # show available designs of experimentation
pmk -l model  # show available models
pmk -l script # show available scripts
pmk show expe_name # or just pymake expe_name
```

Run experiments:

```bash
pmk run [expe_name] --script script_name [script options...]
# Or shortly (alias):
pmk [expe_name] -x script_name
# Run in parallel:
pmk [expe_name] -x script_name --cores N_CORES
```

Show Paths for disks I/O:

    pmk path [expe_name] [script options...]

Show individuals commands for asynchronously purpose (@deprecated):

    pmk cmd [expe_name] [script options...]

##### Designing experiments

##### Specifications


A design of experiment is defined as one of the following type:
* ExpSpace: A subclass of `dict` => 1 experiment
* ExpTensor: A subclass of `dict` => many experiments (Cartesian Product of all `list` entrie of the dict)
* ExpGroup: A subclass of `list` => group of ExpSpace or ExpTensor.

Design of experiment (ExpSpace, ExpTensor or ExpGroup) must live inside a class that inherit `ExpDesign`. Those classes live in files inside the `spec/` directory. You'll need the following import:
`from pymake import ExpDesign, ExpSpace, ExpTensor, ExpGroup`


The following examples need to be instantiated in class that inherits `ExpDesign`: `class MyDesign(ExpDesign)`.

To specify an unique experiment, one can use the `ExpSpace` class:

```python
exp1 = ExpSpace(name = 'myexpe',
        size = 42,
        key1 = 100,
        key2 = 'johndoe'
        _format = '{name}-{size}-{key1}_{key2}'
        )
```

To specify a **grid search**, one can use the `ExpTensor` class:

```python
exp2 = ExpTensor(name = 'myexpe',
        size = [42, 100],
        key1 = list(range(20, 1000))
        key2 = 'johndoe'
        _format = '{name}-{size}-{key1}_{key2}'
        )
```

Which will results in four experiments where "size" and "key1" settings take different values.

The third class is the `ExpGroup` which allows to group several design of experiments (for example if they have different settings name):

```python
exp3 = ExpGroup([exp1, exp2])
```

You can then run `pmk -l` to see our design of experiments.

##### Designing a Model

Basically, A model is a class inside `model/` that have a method `fit`.

(Doc in progress for more fancy use cases of design.)

##### Designing a Script

A script is a piece of code that you execute which is parameterized by a **specification**. More specifically, Scripts are methods of class that inherits a `ExpeFormat` and that lives inside the `script/` folder.

Once you defined some scripts, you'll be able to list them with `pmk -l script`, and to run them, by their name, with `pmk [specification_id] -x script_name`.

Then each experiments defined in your design (or _default_expe if no specification_id is given), will go through the script method. Then, a bunch of facilities are living inside the method at runtime:

* `self.expe`:  The settings of the current experiment,
* `self._it`: The ith script running inside the script,
* and more (doc in progress)


##### Track your data and results

In order to save and analyse your results, each unique experiment need to be identified in a file. To do so, Pymake comes with its own mechanism to map the settings/specification to an unique <filename>s. Pymake use the following conventions:

* <filename>.inf: csv file where each lines contains the state of the iterative process of an experiment,
* <filename>.pk: to save complex objects usually at the end of an experiments, and load it after for analysis/visualization,
* <filename>.json: to save information of an experiments ("database friendly").

###### formatting the filename -- _format

The choice of the filename will depends on the settings of the experiments. In order to specify the format of the filename, there is the special settings `--format  str_fmt`. `str_fmt` is a string template for the filename, with braces delimiter to specify what settings will be replaced, example:

Suppose we have the following settings:

```python
settings = ExpSpace(name = 'myexpe',
        size = 42,
        key1 = 100,
        key2 = 'johndoe'
        _format = '{name}-{size}-{key1}_{key2}'
        )
```

The filename for this unique experiment will be 'myexpe-42-100_johndoe'


To give an unique identifier of an expe belonging to a group of experiments (`ExpTensor` or `ExpGroup`) one can use the special term `{_id}` (unique counter identifier) and `${name}` (name of experiment as given in the ExpDesign class) in the `_format` attribute.

###### settings the path -- _refdir

By default all experiments results files will be written in the same directory (specify in `pymake.cfg`). In order to give a special subdirectory name for an experiment, the settings `--refdir str` is a string that represents the subdirectory for results files of the experiments.

###### Specifying what data to save in .inf files.

<!--
Suppose you a script `fit` that execute a fit method of a given model. You may want to observe the convergence some quantities of your model trough iterations. The way to achieve this with pmk is to use the special settings `_csv_typo` that contains the attribute of your model you want to track.

Once you provide this settings, you need to inject a function in the fit method of your model to track the results.

## man pymake [](#man)

pymake (pmk) command-line reference.

```bash
init = command$;
command = 'pmk' [command_name] [expedesign_id]* [expe_id]* [pmk_options];
command_name = 'run' | 'runpara' | 'path' | 'cmd' | 'update' | 'show' | 'hist' |  '' ;
expe_id = int; # int identifier of an expe from 0 to; size(exp) -1.
expedesign_id = [exp id/name]; # string identifier to an exp
pmk_options = [pymake special options + project options];
```

### Command_name
If 'expe_name' is empty and `-x` is given, pymake assumes `run` command. If 'expedesing_id is empty', then the parameters are empty unless the script defines a `_default_expe` expe settings. All settings undefined in a design but defined in the `_default_exp` will take this value.

Remark: -l and -s (--simulate) options don't execute, they just show things up.

### Expedesign_id
Pick among all (design of) experiments in {spec}. To list them `pmk -l spec`.

### pmk_options
Here are all the special options that own pymake, such as --refdir, --format, --script, -w, -l, -h etc. Additionally, all the options for the current project should be added in the `grammarg.py` file.
